I’m Zhicong Lu (陆志聪, Caleb), an assistant professor of Computer Science at [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I was an assistant professor at [the Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/){:target="\_blank"}, [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/){:target="\_blank"} previously. I finished my PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of Professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~dwigdor/">Daniel Wigdor</a>. Previously I was a Master of Interdisciplinary Studies of Information and Art Design at Tsinghua University, China, supervised by Professor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.x-studio.org.cn/~yqxu">Ying-Qing Xu</a> and Professor <a target="_blank" href="http://media.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~pervasive/shiyc/">Yuanchun Shi</a>. Before starting my master, I had a bachelor of Electronic Engineering and Game Design at Tsinghua University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of HCI, social computing, computational social science, and machine learning, especially in studying, designing, and building systems that support social interactions, to enhance trust, engagement, creativity, and knowledge sharing in virtual and physical spaces. I am currently exploring how to leverage emerging media (e.g., livestreaming) and generative AI models for sharing knowledge, enhancing creativity, and safeguarding <a href="https://ich.unesco.org/en/what-is-intangible-heritage-00003">Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH)</a>.
