To better understand this socio-technological phenomenon, we conducted a mixed methods study of live streaming practices in China. We present the results of an online survey of 527 live streaming users, focusing on their broadcasting or viewing practices and the experiences they find most engaging. We also interviewed 14 active users to explore their motivations and experiences. Our data revealed the different categories of content that was broadcasted and how varying aspects of this content engaged viewers. We also gained insight into the role reward systems and fan group-chat play in engaging users, while also finding evidence that both viewers and streamers desire deeper channels and mechanisms for interaction in addition to the commenting, gifting, and fan groups that are available today.},

abstract="Short-form video sharing mobile applications like TikTok (Douyin) have been gaining traction globally in recent years. These video sharing platforms have transformed how users consume online content in a drastic way. The recommendation algorithms of these applications form a ``ludic loop'' for users -- the more users watch videos, the better the algorithms work, and the more users are exposed to content of their interest. Although prior research has explored how and why users watch short-form videos, relatively little research has studied those who choose not to use Douyin. To address this, we conducted a survey study with Internet users in China (N = 192), focusing specifically on Douyin and those who have abandoned or never adopted Douyin. Our results show that various perceptions of these users shape diverse practices of engagement with and disengagement from Douyin. Those who choose not to use Douyin are mostly motivated by the fear of addiction, or the stigmatized perceptions of videos on Douyin that deemed low-quality. Those who are using Douyin and those who choose to quit Douyin have different perceptions of the efficacy of Douyin's recommendation algorithms. We situate our findings with prior research on technology non-use, and provide design implications for future video-based social media.",

abstract = {In social Virtual Reality (VR), users are embodied in avatars and interact with other users in a face-to-face manner using avatars as the medium. With the advent of social VR, people with disabilities (PWD) have shown an increasing presence on this new social media. With their unique disability identity, it is not clear how PWD perceive their avatars and whether and how they prefer to disclose their disability when presenting themselves in social VR. We fill this gap by exploring PWD’s avatar perception and disability disclosure preferences in social VR. Our study involved two steps. We first conducted a systematic review of fifteen popular social VR applications to evaluate their avatar diversity and accessibility support. We then conducted an in-depth interview study with 19 participants who had different disabilities to understand their avatar experiences. Our research revealed a number of disability disclosure preferences and strategies adopted by PWD (e.g., reflect selective disabilities, present a capable self). We also identified several challenges faced by PWD during their avatar customization process. We discuss the design implications to promote avatar accessibility and diversity for future social VR platforms.},

abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) support community engagement of older people to improve their quality of life. Prior research has explored how Information and Communication Technologies(ICTs) enable older people to social connectedness, activity engagement, self-expression, and identity development in older self-organized communities. However, there have been comparatively few studies on how mainstream ICTs help older people manage and develop self-organized communities in China, where the ICTs context differs greatly from the Western world. This study examined how older square dancing groups maintain and develop groups through WeChat groups and video communities. We interviewed fourteen elderly dancers from eight dance groups. We show how the WeChat group and the video community positively contributed to the internal management for maintaining cohesion and external presentation for seeking social identity. We present insights from members’ historical and cultural lens, describe ICTs practice from experiences throughout the country’s previous collectivization phase and provide design implications for further research in this direction.},
